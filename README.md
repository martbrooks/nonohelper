# Nonogram Scratchpad

A simple, browser-based scratchpad to help you solve nonograms more effectively. It provides a clean, responsive grid that you can freely experiment on without altering your real puzzle. No installation is needed — just open the HTML file in a browser.

## ✨ What This Tool Does

When solving nonograms, solvers often need “thinking space” to:

- test out possible fills
- try hypothetical line segments
- experiment with rectangles or blocks
- mark areas that definitely aren’t filled
- zoom in and out on large puzzles
- undo mistakes instantly
- reduce clutter on the real puzzle

This tool provides:

### 🧱 Flexible Grid

- Any size from 5×5 up to 50×50 (rectangular sizes supported)
- Automatic row and column numbering on all sides for easy navigation
- Classic nonogram-style thick borders every 5 cells
- Automatically scales the grid down so the entire board fits on screen when created
- Smooth zooming anywhere on the page (mouse wheel)

### 🖱️ Intuitive Cell Interaction

- Left click cycles: empty → filled → cross → empty
- Right click cycles: empty → cross → filled → empty

“Filled” cells show a rounded black inset square.
“Crossed” cells show a bold red X centred in the cell.

Clicking slightly off a cell (onto a grid line) automatically snaps to the intended target cell.

### ✍️ Multiple Drawing Modes

**Rectangle mode (default)**
Click and drag to mark regions; a tooltip shows the selected width and height (e.g. "8 × 3") in live preview.

**Line mode**
Click and drag mostly horizontally to draw horizontal lines, or mostly vertically for vertical lines. The tooltip shows the line length.

**Freestyle mode**
Draw cell-by-cell, like using a pencil. No rollback within the stroke; changes are batched for undo/redo.

Each mode includes a live preview before committing changes.

### ↩️ Undo / Redo

- Full undo/redo stack (100 actions)
- Works across all modes
- Keyboard shortcuts supported: Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z, and Ctrl+Y

### 🎨 Themes

- Light and dark mode toggle in the toolbar
- Dark mode is the default
- Theme choice is stored and remembered between sessions

### 🧭 Clean Layout

- Page header: "Nonogram Scratchpad"
- Compact controls panel above the grid
- Row and column numbers around the grid
- Footer with GitHub source link
- Everything scales and moves naturally with zoom

## 🤝 How This Tool Was Built

This project was created as a "conversational programming" experiment. The user described behaviour and requirements in natural language, and ChatGPT iteratively refined the code through hundreds of steps.

This version includes major enhancements beyond the earlier iteration:

- Row and column numbering
- Click-snapping on grid lines
- Auto-fit scaling on grid creation
- Improved preview logic
- Rectangle, line, and freestyle drawing modes
- Undo/redo behaviour
- Header title
- Light/dark theme with persistence
- Full internal refactor for readability and maintainability

All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were generated entirely by ChatGPT based on user instructions.

## 🧠 AI Attribution

For transparency:

- All code was generated by ChatGPT.
- The human collaborator provided requirements, testing, and feedback.
- This README was also generated by ChatGPT.
