# Nonogram Scratchpad

A simple, browser-based scratchpad to help you solve nonograms more effectively.
It provides a clean grid you can freely experiment on, without altering your real puzzle.
No installation needed — just open the HTML file in a browser.

## ✨ What This Tool Does

When solving nonograms, solvers often need “thinking space” to:

- test out possible fills
- try hypothetical line segments
- mark areas that definitely *aren’t* filled
- draw rectangles to test interactions
- zoom in and out on large puzzles
- undo mistakes quickly
- avoid scribbling all over the actual puzzle

This tool provides:

- Any grid size from **5×5** up to **50×50** (rectangular sizes supported)
- Click-to-fill behaviour:
  - **Left click:** empty → filled → cross → empty
  - **Right click:** empty → cross → filled → empty
- Three marking modes:
  - **Straight line** (horizontal or vertical)
  - **Rectangle** (default)
  - **Freestyle** (cell-by-cell)
- Drag-to-fill with live region measurement (e.g. “8×3”)
- **Undo/redo** (buttons + keyboard shortcuts)
- **Zoom** using Ctrl/Cmd + mouse wheel
- **Dark and light themes**
- Classic nonogram-style thick borders every 5 cells
- Completely offline and self-contained

It’s designed as a companion tool when solving puzzles on paper, on another website, or in a book.

## 🤝 How This Tool Was Built
### *A conversational programming experiment*

This project was created by a sysadmin who is **not** a web developer.

Instead of manually writing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, the user described the functionality they wanted — step by step — in natural language. Over many iterations, ChatGPT generated the code, refined it, debugged it, and implemented new features as requested.

The process looked like this:

1. **Initial concept:**
   A simple clickable grid for nonogram scratch work.

2. **Progressive feature building:**
   Through a long, interactive back-and-forth, additional features were requested and implemented:
   - refined click behaviour
   - drag-to-fill
   - line / rectangle selection modes
   - zooming
   - dark and light modes
   - bold aligned crosses
   - undo/redo history
   - improved grid rendering using box-shadows
   - several full-file refactors

3. **Polishing:**
   Once the behaviour was correct, ChatGPT performed complete refactors to clean up the structure, remove cruft, and ensure consistency.

4. **Final touches:**
   Licence selection, README drafting, and finishing details were also generated collaboratively.

This repository is therefore an example of **conversational programming** — specifying behaviour in English and shaping the output through discussion.

## 🧠 AI Attribution

For transparency:

- **All code** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) was generated by ChatGPT.
- The human collaborator provided requirements, corrections, feedback, and testing.
- **The README you are reading was also produced as part of the same collaborative chat.**
